# containers
Customized docker architecture to quickly deploy services. This is aimed at development environments, but does not mean that it cannot be used in real environments with the necessary configuration.

:warning: **Is important set .env for the proper behaviour of containers.** 

To start, exec command:
```
cp .env.template .env
```
